# Web Mesh Editor

## Introduction

For the first assignment of the Computer Vision course (with focus in Computer Graphics), I developed this basic 3d modeling tool. 

As I was developing this project I started to understand part of the magic of game engines and modeling software, and that motivated my research around the subject.

Since then I have been improving it but due to lack of time it's still very rough around the edges. In order to keep learning about CG I decided to continue working on it and describe how the various components work. 

At the moment I'm in the process of translating the comments.

## Tools

This project is developed in pure JavaScript and doesn't use any frameworks.

GLSL was used for shader programming.

## Resources

During development I came across various interesting websites that explained the different CG topics. Because the list is a little long, it's stored in the file [Web_sources.txt](https://github.com/Diogo525/Web-Mesh-Editor/blob/master/_assets/Web_sources.txt).
